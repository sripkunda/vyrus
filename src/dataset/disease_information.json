It is a serious condition. If you have it, the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs become hard and narrow. Your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through. Over time, your heart weakens and cannot do its job and you can develop heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of PH  include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath during routine activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A racing heartbeat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain on the upper right side of the abdomen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As PH worsens, you may find it hard to do any physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main kinds of PH.

It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; attack.  Most &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hearts&lt;/span&gt;' blood supply, causing permanent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, CAD can also weaken the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; muscle and contribute to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; failure and arrhythmias. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt; failure means the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; can't pump blood well to the rest of the body.

There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt; is the more common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden severe headache with no known cause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to treat &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;strokes&lt;/span&gt; as quickly as possible.

Viral &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt; is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;, you are at risk of also getting bacterial &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;. The different viruses that can cause &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some common cold and flu viruses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt; is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems.

It is serious and can lead to septic shock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lung abscesses, which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pleural disorders, which are conditions that affect the pleura.

It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pleural fluid culture, which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural space&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatment for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt; depends on the type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics treat bacterial &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt; and some types of fungal &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;. They do not work for viral &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments.

This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attack.  Most &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;hearts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' blood supply, causing permanent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, CAD can also weaken the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; muscle and contribute to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; failure and arrhythmias. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; failure means the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can't pump blood well to the rest of the body.

They can include\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dust mites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mold&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nonallergic &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing in cold air&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain medicines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Household chemicals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infections such as colds and the flu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outdoor air pollution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tobacco smoke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Occupational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise-induced &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Asthma&lt;/span&gt; triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Asthma&lt;/span&gt; affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; than people of other races or ethnicities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sex. In children, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest tightness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing, especially at night or early morning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are having an &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;. If you are having &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; symptoms and prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; attacks. It will include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-term relief medicines,  also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control medicines.  You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your provider may adjust your treatment until &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; symptoms are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt; is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;asthma&lt;/span&gt;, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html"},"Diabetes":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.  Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.  With type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your body does not make insulin.  With type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes.  This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.  Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.    It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb.

Your body needs some &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; it needs. &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have too much &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, where your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked.&lt;/p&gt;What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL?&lt;p&gt;HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because it carries &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; from your body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What causes high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of bad fats. One type, saturated fat, is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Another type, trans fat, is in some fried and processed foods. Eating these fats can raise your LDL (bad) &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking, which lowers HDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;, especially in women. It also raises your LDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics may also cause people to have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. For example, familial &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypercholesterolemia&lt;/span&gt; (FH) is an inherited form of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also cause high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;What can raise my risk of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;A variety of things can raise your risk for high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age. Your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heredity. High blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; can run in families.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Race. Certain races may have an increased risk of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; levels than whites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What health problems can high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; cause?&lt;p&gt;If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;How is high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. There is a blood test to measure your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; level. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are age 19 or younger::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first test should be between ages 9 to 11&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children should have the test again every 5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;, heart attack, or stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are age 20 or older::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Younger adults should have the test every 5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How can I lower my &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;You can lower your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;-lowering drugs available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with familial &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypercholesterolemia&lt;/span&gt; (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; from the blood.

If you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, less air flows in and out of your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; because of one or more problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The walls of the &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; become thick and inflamed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; make more mucus than usual and can become clogged&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; includes two main types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Chronic&lt;/span&gt; bronchitis, in which the lining of your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have both emphysema and &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;chronic&lt;/span&gt; bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;What causes &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;p&gt;The cause of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt;. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially if you inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;p&gt;The risk factors for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; smoke or used to smoke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age. Most people who have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are more likely to get it if they have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asthma.

But most people with asthma will not get &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;p&gt;At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt; gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tightness in your chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;) diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor will diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (chronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;obstructive&lt;/span&gt; pulmonary &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;. Treatments include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle changes, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt;. This helps open your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;airways&lt;/span&gt; and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are at higher risk for serious problems from these &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen therapy, if you have severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and low levels of oxygen in your blood.

It's the most common type of arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/span&gt;, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/span&gt;. It usually gets worse slowly.

They think that it could be caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. Your chance of developing &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/span&gt; increases with age.

After age 50, it is more common in women than in men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being overweight. Extra weight puts more stress on your joints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a past injury or surgery on a joint.

If they don't help enough, your provider may prescribe injections (shots) into the joint or prescription pain relievers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementary therapies may help some people. Massage can increase blood flow and bring warmth to the area. Some research shows that acupuncture may help relieve &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/span&gt; pain. Simple things like heat and ice can help, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If none of these treatments help enough, surgery may be an option.

This scale measures your ability to open your eyes, speak, and move.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May do neuropsychological tests to check how your brain is functioning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for traumatic brain injury (TBI)?&lt;p&gt;The treatments for TBI depend on many factors, including the size, severity, and location of the brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mild TBI, the main treatment is rest. If you have a headache, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers. It is important to follow your health care provider's instructions for complete rest and a gradual return to your normal activities. If you start doing too much too soon, it may take longer to recover. Contact your provider if your symptoms are not getting better or if you have new symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For moderate to severe TBI, the first thing health care providers will do is stabilize you to prevent further injury. They will manage your blood pressure, check the pressure inside your skull, and make sure that there is enough blood and oxygen getting to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are stable, the treatments may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery to reduce additional damage to your brain, for example to\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove hematomas (clotted blood)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get rid of damaged or dead brain tissue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repair skull fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relieve pressure in the skull&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines to treat the symptoms of TBI and to lower some of the risks associated with it, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anti-anxiety medication to lessen feelings of nervousness and fear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anticoagulants to prevent blood clots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anticonvulsants to prevent seizures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antidepressants to treat symptoms of depression and mood instability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle relaxants to reduce muscle spasms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stimulants to increase alertness and attention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rehabilitation therapies, which can include therapies for physical, emotional, and cognitive difficulties:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical therapy, to build physical strength, coordination, and flexibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Occupational therapy, to help you learn or relearn how to perform daily tasks, such as getting dressed, cooking, and bathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speech therapy, to help you to with speech and other communication skills and treat swallowing disorders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychological counseling, to help you learn coping skills, work on relationships, and improve your emotional well-being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vocational counseling, which focuses on your ability to return to work and deal with workplace challenges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cognitive therapy, to improve your memory, attention, perception, learning, planning, and judgment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with TBI may have permanent disabilities. A TBI can also put you at risk for other health problems such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treating these problems can improve your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;Can traumatic brain injury (TBI) be prevented?&lt;p&gt;There are steps you can take to prevent head injuries and TBIs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wear your seatbelt and use car seats and booster seats for children&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a properly fitting helmet when riding a bicycle, skateboarding, and playing sports like hockey and football&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevent falls by\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making your house safer. For example, you can install railings on the stairs and grab bars in the tub, get rid of tripping hazards, and use window guards and stair safety gates for young children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving your balance and strength with regular physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/traumaticbraininjury.html"},"Malignant neoplasms":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;tumor. Tumors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can be benign or &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;malignant&lt;/span&gt;.

Most &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;cancers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are named for where they start. For example, lung &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; starts in the lung, and breast &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; starts in the breast. The spread of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; type and how advanced it is.

Having an STD can increase your risk of getting or spreading &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who inject drugs with shared needles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gay and bisexual men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; diagnoses and people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;, compared to other races and ethnicities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The first signs of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may be flu-like symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth ulcers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is not treated, it becomes chronic &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, called opportunistic &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OIs). OIs are &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. So the only way to know for sure whether you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; is to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;How do I know if I have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;A blood test can tell if you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  ART can make &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting tested for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting tested and treated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not injecting drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking to your health care provider about medicines to prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;:\n\t\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institutes of Health&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html"},"Septicemia":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Sepsis&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"What is &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;sepsis&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Sepsis&lt;/span&gt; is your body's overactive and extreme response to an infection. &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Sepsis&lt;/span&gt; is a life-threatening medical emergency.

To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do a physical exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run some tests, including various imaging tests and possibly some blood tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for a &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;pulmonary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;embolism&lt;/span&gt; (PE)?&lt;p&gt;If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thrombolytics are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procedures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catheter-assisted thrombus removal uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;lungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which prevents &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;pulmonary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;embolism&lt;/span&gt;.

Prevention may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, quitting smoking\n&lt;/li&gt;Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n&lt;li&gt;Moving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Heart, &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and Blood Institute&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryembolism.html"},"Chronic kidney failure":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Kidney&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Failure&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;Healthy &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;kidneys&lt;/span&gt; clean your blood by removing excess fluid, minerals, and wastes.

These symptoms may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark yellow urine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gray- or clay-colored stools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and/or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in your abdomen (belly)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jaundice (yellowish eyes and skin)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chronic &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; screening is important, even if you have no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;What other problems can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; cause?&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; can prevent these complications.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Providers diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an ultrasound of the liver, and a liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatment for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have acute &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;, your provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccine for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;.

Depressive episodes are also common. Those often last at least two weeks. This type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; can also involve mixed episodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Bipolar&lt;/span&gt; II &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; involves depressive episodes. But instead of full-blown manic episodes, there are episodes of hypomania. Hypomania is a less severe version of mania.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cyclothymic &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;, or cyclothymia, also involves hypomanic and depressive symptoms.

Several factors likely play a role in the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;.

Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise this risk even more.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; can vary. But they involve mood swings known as mood episodes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a manic episode can include\n     &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very up, high, or elated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a very short temper or seeming extremely irritable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having racing thoughts and talking very fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing less sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling like you are unusually important, talented, or powerful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eating and drinking too much, spending or giving away a lot of money, or having reckless sex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; \n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a depressive episode can include\n    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very sad, hopeless, or worthless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling lonely or isolating yourself from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking very slowly, feeling like you have nothing to say, or forgetting a lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having little energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleeping too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating too much or too little&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of interest in your usual activities and being unable to do even simple things&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking about death or suicide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a mixed episode include both manic and depressive symptoms together. For example, you may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while at the same time feeling extremely energized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; may have milder symptoms. For example, you may have hypomania instead of mania. With hypomania, you may feel very good and find that you can get a lot done. You may not feel like anything is wrong. But your family and friends may notice your mood swings and changes in activity levels. They may realize that your behavior is unusual for you. After the hypomania, you might have severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mood episodes may last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, symptoms usually occur every day for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;, your health care provider may use many tools:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A physical exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history, which will include asking about your symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical tests to rule out other conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mental health evaluation. Your provider may do the evaluation or may refer you to a mental health specialist to get one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;. The main treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; include medicines, psychotherapy, or both:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines can help control the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;. You may need to try several different medicines to find which one works best for you. Some people need to take more than one medicine. It's important to take your medicine consistently. Don't stop taking it without first talking with your provider.  Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other treatment options include\n    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. ECT is most often used for severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular aerobic exercise may help with depression, anxiety, and trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping a life chart can help you and your provider track and treat your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;. A life chart is a record of your daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    \n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Bipolar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; is a lifelong &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;illness&lt;/span&gt;.

Your body needs some &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; it needs. &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have too much &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, where your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked.&lt;/p&gt;What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL?&lt;p&gt;HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because it carries &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; from your body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What causes high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of bad fats. One type, saturated fat, is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Another type, trans fat, is in some fried and processed foods. Eating these fats can raise your LDL (bad) &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking, which lowers HDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;, especially in women. It also raises your LDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics may also cause people to have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also cause high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;What can raise my risk of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;A variety of things can raise your risk for high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age. Your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heredity. High blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; can run in families.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Race. Certain races may have an increased risk of high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; levels than whites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What health problems can high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; cause?&lt;p&gt;If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;How is high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;. There is a blood test to measure your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; level. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are age 19 or younger::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first test should be between ages 9 to 11&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children should have the test again every 5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;, heart attack, or stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are age 20 or older::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Younger adults should have the test every 5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How can I lower my &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;You can lower your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;-lowering drugs available, including statins.

It causes redness, itching, and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant, such as a chemical, or something you are allergic to, like poison ivy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need  long-term treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it.

Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces so they can shift easily as the body moves. Adhesions cause tissues and organs to stick together. They might connect the loops of the intestines to each other, to nearby organs, or to the wall of the abdomen. They can pull sections of the intestines out of place. This may block food from passing through the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhesions can occur anywhere in the body. But they often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don't cause any problems. But when they partly or completely block the intestines, they cause symptoms such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe abdominal pain or cramping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An inability to pass gas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No tests are available to detect adhesions.  Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some adhesions go away by themselves. If they partly block your intestines, a diet low in fiber can allow food to move easily through the affected area. If you have a complete intestinal obstruction, it is life-threatening.

It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.&lt;/p&gt;What is an enlarged &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; (BPH)?&lt;p&gt;An enlarged &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; is when your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;benign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostatic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; hyperplasia&lt;/span&gt; or BPH for short. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Benign&lt;/span&gt; means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; condition in people over age 50. As the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.  When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH.&lt;/p&gt;What causes an enlarged &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; (BPH)?&lt;p&gt;Researchers aren't sure why the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; keeps growing.

But BPH increases your chance of developing serious conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute urinary retention. With this condition, you suddenly can't urinate at all. This a medical emergency.  Acute urinary retention is common in older males and the chance of having it increases with age. It may be triggered by:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking certain over-the-counter cold or allergy medicines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold temperatures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not moving enough over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urinary tract infections (UTIs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bladder damage and bladder stones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney damage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is BPH diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To find out if you have BPH, your provider will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your medical history. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, because certain medicines can make BPH symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your family health history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine you. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to check if your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; is large, tender, or irregular in any other way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order medical tests, if needed, such as:\n\t\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urine tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A PSA blood test (&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;-specific antigen test).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultrasound pictures of your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; and urinary tract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; biopsy to diagnose or rule out &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for BPH?&lt;p&gt;Not everyone needs treatment for BPH.

Risk factors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting older &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being small and thin &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking certain medicines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being a white or Asian woman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having low bone density&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt; is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, exercise, and do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help. It is also important to try to avoid falling down. Falls are the number one cause of fractures in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin \nDiseases&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html"},"Incontinence":{"name":"Urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Incontinence&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"What is urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI)?&lt;p&gt;Urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.&lt;/p&gt;What are the types of urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI)?&lt;p&gt;There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urge, or urgency, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overflow &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixed &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; means that you have more than one type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt;. It's usually a combination of stress and urge &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transient &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; goes away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it.\n   &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In adults, the causes include some medicines, caffeine, and alcohol. It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as diabetes insipidus, a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, enlarged prostate (BPH), and sleep apnea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Who is at risk for urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI)?&lt;p&gt;In adults, you are at higher risk of developing UI if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are older. As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are a man with prostate problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have certain health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, or long-lasting constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are a smoker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a birth defect that affects the structure of your urinary tract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children.&lt;/p&gt;How is urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI) diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. The bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. Women may also get a pelvic exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urine and/or blood tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bladder function tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for urinary &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;incontinence&lt;/span&gt; (UI)?&lt;p&gt;Treatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle changes to reduce leaks:\n        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being physically active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying at a healthy weigh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bladder training. This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines, which can be used to\n        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical devices, including\n        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulking agents, which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. This helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electrical nerve stimulation, which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery to support the bladder in its normal position. This may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/urinaryincontinence.html"},"Pancreatitis":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Pancreatitis&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine.

Once you become an adult, your personality usually doesn't change much.&lt;/p&gt;What are personality disorders?&lt;p&gt;Personality disorders are a group of mental disorders. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are different from what is considered normal in your culture. The thoughts and behaviors are unhealthy and inflexible. They cause serious problems with relationships, work, and social activities. They can make it hard to deal with everyday stresses and problems.&lt;/p&gt;What are the types of personality disorders?&lt;p&gt;There are 10 types of personality disorders. They are grouped into three different categories called clusters. The types in each cluster have some similar symptoms and characteristics. The clusters and types are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cluster A personality disorders involve unusual and odd thoughts and behaviors. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Paranoid&lt;/span&gt; personality disorder, in which a person has &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;paranoia&lt;/span&gt; (an extreme fear and distrust of others). They may think that someone is trying to harm them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schizoid personality disorder, in which a person prefers to be alone and is not interested in having relationships with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schizotypal personality disorder, in which a person has unusual thoughts and ways of behaving and speaking. They are uncomfortable having close relationships with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cluster B personality disorders involve dramatic and emotional thoughts and behaviors that can keep changing.

The cause is unknown. However, genes and childhood experiences such as abuse and trauma likely play a role.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of personality disorders?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of each personality disorder are different.

The disorders also cause problems in relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;How are personality disorders diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;A mental health care provider can diagnose personality disorders. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. To make a diagnosis, the provider will consider the person's symptoms, experiences, and family medical history. A thorough medical exam may also be done to help rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;How are personality disorders treated?&lt;p&gt;Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, is the main treatment for personality disorders.

A high PSA blood level may be a sign of &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But many other things can cause high PSA levels, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging tests. These tests may use ultrasound or MRI to make pictures of your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these tests show that you might have &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the next step is usually a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a biopsy, a doctor uses a hollow needle to remove some &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; tissue. The tissue is studied under a microscope to look for &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, and how serious the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; is. Your treatment may include one or more of options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observation,which is mostly used if you are older, your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; isn't likely to grow quickly, and you don't have symptoms or you have other medical conditions. Your doctor will keep checking on your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; over time so to see whether you will need to start treatment for the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;. There are two types of observation:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watchful waiting means having little or no testing. If symptoms begin or change, you will get treatment to relieve them, but not to treat the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active surveillance means having regular tests to see if your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has changed. If the tests show the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery to remove your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; gland may be an option if your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; hasn't spread outside of your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells or prevent them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy blocks &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells. This treatment causes less harm to healthy cells than radiation therapy or chemotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunotherapy helps your own immune system to fight &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;Making healthy lifestyle changes may help to prevent some &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. These changes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being at a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating healthy foods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Cancer&lt;/span&gt; Institute&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/prostatecancer.html"},"Stenosis aortic valve":{"name":"Heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;Valve&lt;/span&gt; Diseases","summary":"What are heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease happens when one or more of your heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; don't work well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your heart has four &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt;: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;aortic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves. The valves&lt;/span&gt; have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one or more of your heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases.&lt;/p&gt;What are the types of heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; can have three basic kinds of problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regurgitation, or backflow, happens when the flaps of a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Stenosis&lt;/span&gt; happens when the flaps of a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Aortic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;stenosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a common type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;stenosis&lt;/span&gt;. It affects the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atresia happens when a heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; can have both regurgitation and &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;stenosis&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;What causes heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Some people are born with heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease. This is called congenital heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. Heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart.&lt;/p&gt;Who is more likely to develop heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Your chance of having heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease is higher if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are older. With age, the heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; can become thick and stiff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt;. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endocarditis. This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt;. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease, especially when it affects the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;aorta&lt;/span&gt; (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity and overweight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A family history of early heart disease:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born with an &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;aortic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; may work well enough for years before causing problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Many people live their whole lives with a heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain when you're physically active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness or fainting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't get treatment for heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;What other problems can heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases cause?&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart can lead to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood clots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest or death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; disease diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; diseases?&lt;p&gt;Most heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery to repair or replace a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; can help can prevent future heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; problem and general health. Heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; repair surgery has fewer risks than heart &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt; replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biologic &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical (human-made) &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valves&lt;/span&gt; usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt;, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. And your risk of endocarditis (a heart infection) is higher than with a biologic &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;valve&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/heartvalvediseases.html"},"Hernia":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Hernia&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hernia&lt;/span&gt; happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle.

They're also more likely to:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at a younger age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have more serious &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Die from &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;Prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; doesn't always cause symptoms, especially at first. If it does cause symptoms, they may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problems urinating (peeing), such as:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A urine stream that's weak, hard to start, or starts and stops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suddenly needing to urinate right away&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urinating often, especially at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or burning when urinating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in your urine or semen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in your lower back, hips, or pelvis that does not go away&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Painful ejaculation (the release of semen through the penis during orgasm)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of these symptoms may be from other common &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; problems that aren't &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, such as an enlarged &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should discuss your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; health with your health care provider if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have symptoms that could be &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a high risk for developing &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a screening test that suggests you could have &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; tests and how is &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Tests which check for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A digital rectal exam (DRE). In this exam, your provider feels your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; for lumps or anything unusual by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. A high PSA blood level may be a sign of &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But many other things can cause high PSA levels, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging tests. These tests may use ultrasound or MRI to make pictures of your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these tests show that you might have &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the next step is usually a &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a biopsy, a doctor uses a hollow needle to remove some &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; tissue. The tissue is studied under a microscope to look for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, and how serious the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is. Your treatment may include one or more of options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observation,which is mostly used if you are older, your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; isn't likely to grow quickly, and you don't have symptoms or you have other medical conditions. Your doctor will keep checking on your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over time so to see whether you will need to start treatment for the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There are two types of observation:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watchful waiting means having little or no testing. If symptoms begin or change, you will get treatment to relieve them, but not to treat the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active surveillance means having regular tests to see if your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has changed. If the tests show the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery to remove your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; gland may be an option if your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hasn't spread outside of your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells or prevent them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy blocks &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells. This treatment causes less harm to healthy cells than radiation therapy or chemotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunotherapy helps your own immune system to fight &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;Making healthy lifestyle changes may help to prevent some &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;prostate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

This involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;breasts&lt;/span&gt; and armpits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging tests, such as a mammogram, an ultrasound, or an MRI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;Breast&lt;/span&gt; biopsy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and an electrolyte panel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these tests show that you have &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, you will have tests that study the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic tests for genetic changes such as in the BRCA and TP53 genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HER2 test. HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt; cells. If your &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may grow more quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another step is staging the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; has spread within the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt; or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; has spread to the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;mastectomy&lt;/span&gt;, which removes the whole &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lumpectomy to remove the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; and some normal tissue around it, but not the &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt; itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiation therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemotherapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy, which blocks &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells from getting the hormones they need to grow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; cells with less harm to normal cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You may be able to help prevent &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;breast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by making healthy lifestyle changes such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying at a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough exercisee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting your exposure to estrogen by\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breastfeeding your babies if you can&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting hormone therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk.

It happens to both men and women, but men often develop it at a younger age than women.  Your chance of developing heart failure increases if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're 65 years old or older.

Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of heart failure?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of heart failure depend on which side of your heart is affected and how serious your condition has become.  Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;fluid&lt;/span&gt; buildup in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Fluid&lt;/span&gt; buildup happens because the flow of blood through your heart is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your heart. &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Fluid&lt;/span&gt; may leak from the blood vessels and collect in the tissues of your body, causing swelling (edema) and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of heart failure may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling short of breath (like you can't get enough air) when you do things like climbing stairs.

There's no cure for heart failure. But treatment can help you live longer with fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with treatment, heart failure usually gets worse over time, so you'll likely need treatment for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most treatment plans include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking medicine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating less sodium and drinking less liquid to control &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;fluid&lt;/span&gt; buildup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making other changes, such as quitting smoking, managing stress, and getting as much physical activity as your health care provider recommends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating any conditions that may make heart failure worse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may need heart surgery if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a congenital heart defect or damage to your heart that can be fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The left side of your heart is getting weaker and putting a device in your chest could help. Devices include:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An implantable cardioverter defibrillator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A biventricular pacemaker (cardiac resynchronization therapy).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mechanical heart pump (a ventricular assist device (VAD) or a total artificial heart).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your heart doctor recommends a heart transplant because your heart failure is life-threatening and nothing else is helping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of your treatment, you'll need to pay close attention to your symptoms, because heart failure can worsen suddenly.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.&lt;/p&gt;What is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For people who don't have diabetes, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What causes &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines. It can happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you get a lot more physical activity than usual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you drink too much alcohol without enough food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shaking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nervousness or anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Irritability or confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hunger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have diabetes and you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;If you have mild or moderate &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt;, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/span&gt; if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you take diabetes medicines, make sure to take them correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/hypoglycemia.html"},"Colitis":{"name":"Ulcerative &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Colitis&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;colitis&lt;/span&gt; (UC) is a disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the lining of the rectum and colon.

Your provider may suggest slowly adding solid foods to your diet as your symptoms improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines for pain.

This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of DKA may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in your abdomen (belly)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very tired or sleepy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms.

It causes people to lose the ability to remember, think, and use good judgment. They also have trouble taking care of themselves. Over time, as the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt; gets worse, they will need more and more help. As a caregiver, it is important for you to learn about AD. You will want to know what happens to the person during the different stages of the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disease&lt;/span&gt;. This can help you plan for the future, so that you will have all of the resources you will need to be able to take care of your loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a caregiver for someone with AD, your responsibilities can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting your loved one's health, legal, and financial affairs in order. If possible, include them in the planning while they can still make decisions. Later you will need to take over managing their finances and paying their bills.\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating their house and making sure it's safe for their needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring their ability to drive. You may want to hire a driving specialist who can test their driving skills. When it is no longer safe for your loved one to drive, you need to make sure that they stop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encouraging your loved one to get some physical activity. Exercising together may make it more fun for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making sure that your loved one has a healthy diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping with daily tasks like bathing, eating, or taking medicine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing housework and cooking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Running errands such as shopping for food and clothes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Driving them to appointments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing company and emotional support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arranging medical care and making health decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you care for your loved one with AD, don't ignore your own needs. Caregiving can be stressful, and you need to take care of your own physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, you will not be able to do everything on your own. Make sure that you get help when you need it. There are many different services available, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Home care services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adult day care services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Respite services, which provide short-term care for the person with AD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Federal and state government programs that can provide financial support and services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted living facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nursing homes, some of which have special memory care units for people with AD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Palliative and hospice care&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might consider hiring a geriatric care manager.

Screening tests look for signs of a disease before you have any symptoms. They can help find &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; early, when it may be easier to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts recommend that start screenings at 45 and continue until at least age 75. People over 75 and those who are at high risk should talk to their providers about how often you need screening and what type of test they should get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The types of tests include different stool tests and procedures such as colonoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your provider about how often you need screening and what type of test you should get.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;colorectal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;If you have symptoms that could be caused by &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;colorectal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; or if your screening test results are abnormal, you may need to have more tests to find out if you have &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;. Possible tests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A physical exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A digital rectal exam. For this exam, your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps or anything unusual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tests that are also used for screening (colonoscopy, stool tests, etc.) and biopsy, if you have not already had them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other blood and tissue tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;colorectal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, how serious the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; is, and which type of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;colon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, your treatment may include one or more of these options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiofrequency ablation, a procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells.

It runs in families. In PKD, many cysts grow in the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;kidneys&lt;/span&gt;. This can enlarge the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;kidneys&lt;/span&gt; and make them work poorly. About half of people with the most common type of PKD end up with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;kidney&lt;/span&gt; failure. PKD also causes cysts in other parts of the body, such as the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there are no symptoms at first.

It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.&lt;/p&gt;What is hyperglycemia?&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.  &lt;/p&gt;What causes hyperglycemia?&lt;p&gt;A key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity. You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, certain medicines, and severe illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of hyperglycemia?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of hyperglycemia include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling thirsty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or weak&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urinating (peeing) often&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;diabetic&lt;/span&gt; and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;What other problems can hyperglycemia cause?&lt;p&gt;If hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;ketoacidosis&lt;/span&gt; (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of DKA may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in your abdomen (belly)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very tired or sleepy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help.&lt;/p&gt;How is hyperglycemia diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for hyperglycemia?&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin.&lt;/p&gt;Can hyperglycemia be prevented?&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia.

Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people who have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; may become very sleepy or lose consciousness.

The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are diagnosed with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram).

You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; can often be treated at home. But if your chronic &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; is severe, you might need treatment in a long-term care center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen therapy, through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracheostomy, a surgically-made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ventilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. Another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth, to help you breathe in and out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluids, often through an intravenous (IV), to improve blood flow throughout your body. They also provide nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines for discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatments for the cause of the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;respiratory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;.

This is the most important risk factor for &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in women.

The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family history of &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being exposed to radiation, such as from\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radiation therapy to the breast or chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radon in the home or workplace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain imaging tests such as CT scans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air pollution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not cause any signs or symptoms.

This is called staging.

But each &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; involves problems and uncertainty with how people see themselves. The &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorders&lt;/span&gt; also cause problems in relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;personality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;How are &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;personality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;A mental health care provider can diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;personality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.

This is the most important risk factor for &lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt4\"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking.

Depressive episodes are also common. Those often last at least two weeks. This type of &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can also involve mixed episodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bipolar II &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt; involves depressive episodes. But instead of full-blown &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;manic&lt;/span&gt; episodes, there are episodes of hypomania. Hypomania is a less severe version of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;mania&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cyclothymic &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;, or cyclothymia, also involves hypomanic and depressive symptoms. But they are not as intense or as long-lasting as hypomanic or depressive episodes. The symptoms usually last for at least two years in adults and for one year in children and teenagers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any of these types, having four or more episodes of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;mania&lt;/span&gt; or depression in a year is called \"rapid cycling.\"&lt;/p&gt;What causes &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is unknown. Several factors likely play a role in the &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;.

But they involve mood swings known as mood episodes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;manic&lt;/span&gt; episode can include\n     &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very up, high, or elated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a very short temper or seeming extremely irritable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having racing thoughts and talking very fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing less sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling like you are unusually important, talented, or powerful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eating and drinking too much, spending or giving away a lot of money, or having reckless sex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; \n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a depressive episode can include\n    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very sad, hopeless, or worthless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling lonely or isolating yourself from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking very slowly, feeling like you have nothing to say, or forgetting a lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having little energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleeping too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating too much or too little&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of interest in your usual activities and being unable to do even simple things&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking about death or suicide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of a mixed episode include both &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;manic&lt;/span&gt; and depressive symptoms together. For example, you may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while at the same time feeling extremely energized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may have milder symptoms. For example, you may have hypomania instead of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;mania&lt;/span&gt;. With hypomania, you may feel very good and find that you can get a lot done. You may not feel like anything is wrong. But your family and friends may notice your mood swings and changes in activity levels. They may realize that your behavior is unusual for you. After the hypomania, you might have severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mood episodes may last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, symptoms usually occur every day for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To diagnose &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, your health care provider may use many tools:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A physical exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history, which will include asking about your symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical tests to rule out other conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mental health evaluation.

The main treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include medicines, psychotherapy, or both:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines can help control the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. You may need to try several different medicines to find which one works best for you. Some people need to take more than one medicine. It's important to take your medicine consistently. Don't stop taking it without first talking with your provider.  Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other treatment options include\n    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. ECT is most often used for severe &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular aerobic exercise may help with depression, anxiety, and trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping a life chart can help you and your provider track and treat your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A life chart is a record of your daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;    \n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;Bipolar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a lifelong illness.

They include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and anal cancer. So it's important to see your provider to find the cause of the bleeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How are &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To make a diagnosis, your health care provider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will ask about your medical history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will do a physical exam. Often providers can diagnose external &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt; by looking at the area around your anus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will do a digital rectal exam to check for internal &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt;. For this, the provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for anything that is abnormal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May do procedures such as an anoscopy to check for internal &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;If at-home treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt; don't help you, you may need a medical procedure. There are several different procedures that your provider can do in the office. These procedures use different techniques to cause scar tissue to form in the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt;. This cuts off the blood supply, which usually shrinks the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/span&gt;.

The other main type of &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is chronic bronchitis. Most people with &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have both &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Emphysema&lt;/span&gt; affects the air sacs in your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;, the walls between many of the air sacs in the &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.&lt;/p&gt;What causes &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The cause of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lungs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;, especially if you inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The risk factors for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; smoke or used to smoke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term exposure to other &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age. Most people who have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; are more likely to get it if they have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;COPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent coughing or wheezing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A cough that produces a lot mucus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tightness in your chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other tests tests, such as &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle changes, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; irritants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines, such as\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen therapy, if you have severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;emphysema&lt;/span&gt; and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;Pulmonary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An exercise program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disease management training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutritional counseling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychological counseling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to \n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove damaged &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tissue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed.

Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Aphasia&lt;/span&gt; is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expressive &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Receptive &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anomic or amnesia &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; may get better on its own.

Most &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Aphasia&lt;/span&gt; from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;If a health care provider sees signs of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt;, the provider will usually:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include:\n  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MRI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CT scan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If imaging shows signs of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt;, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders).&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Some people fully recover from &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using simpler language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including the person with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; in conversations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much a person recovers depends on many things, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What caused the brain injury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What part of the brain was hurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How badly and how much of the brain was hurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The age and health of the person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You can help prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/span&gt; by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having:\n  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vascular disease (problems with your blood vessels)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protecting your brain from injury:\n  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing the right helmet for sports safety, such as when riding a bike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking action to prevent falls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/aphasia.html"},"Pyelonephritis":{"name":"Urinary Tract Infections","summary":"&lt;p&gt;The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water.

Damaged or abnormal heart tissue and devices in your heart can trap germs more easily than healthy heart tissue. That means your risk of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;endocarditis&lt;/span&gt; is higher if you have:\n\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart valve disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain congenital heart defects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A pacemaker or an implantable defibrillator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A heart valve replacement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are older.

Antibiotics are usually started through an intravenous (IV) line in the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antifungal medicine to treat fungal infections. Your doctor may suggest taking antifungal medicine for the rest of your life to prevent the infection from coming back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue. Surgery may also be done to remove infected tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dental care, especially cleanings, can help reduce the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment may last weeks, and you may need tests to make sure it's working.

The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;delirium&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;Treating the conditions that can cause &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;delirium&lt;/span&gt; may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;delirium&lt;/span&gt; by avoiding sedatives and making sure that the room is kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person.&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/delirium.html"},"Pneumothorax":{"name":"Pleural Disorders","summary":"&lt;p&gt;Your pleura is a large, thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity.

There are several tests for the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Most people with the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you have symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;Can the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu is to get flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html"},"Cholelithiasis":{"name":"&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Gallstones&lt;/span&gt;","summary":"&lt;p&gt;Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver.

You may not always go through every phase each time you have a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt;.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt;. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache. A &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt; usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt; without a headache. Other &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraine&lt;/span&gt; symptoms may include&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postdrome (following the headache).

So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.&lt;/p&gt;How are &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt; treated?&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also other things you can do to feel better:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking fluids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a log of what seems to trigger your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy may help some women whose &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt; seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have frequent or severe &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;migraines&lt;/span&gt;.

If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt; that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt;. This changes the shape of the red blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells. The cells&lt;/span&gt; are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;, shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;-shaped &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt; are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt; usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt; to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cells&lt;/span&gt;.

People with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; disease&lt;/span&gt; (SCD)?&lt;p&gt;In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; trait&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 1 in every 365 black children is born with &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; disease&lt;/span&gt; (SCD)?&lt;p&gt;People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Painful swelling of the hands and feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue or fussiness from &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;anemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;anemia&lt;/span&gt;, organ damage, and infections.&lt;/p&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; disease&lt;/span&gt; (SCD) diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;A blood test can show if you have SCD or &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;sickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; disease&lt;/span&gt; (SCD)?&lt;p&gt;The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger children&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain relievers for acute or chronic pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Childhood vaccinations to prevent infections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood transfusions for severe &lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;anemia&lt;/span&gt;. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other treatments for specific complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/sicklecelldisease.html"},"Bacteremia":{"name":"Sepsis","summary":"What is sepsis?&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is your body's overactive and extreme response to an infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency. Without quick treatment, it can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;What causes sepsis?&lt;p&gt;Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Bacterial infections are the most common cause, but other types of infections can also cause it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infections are often in the lungs, stomach, kidneys, or bladder. It's possible for sepsis to begin with a small cut that gets infected or with an infection that develops after surgery. Sometimes, sepsis can occur in people who didn't even know that they had an infection.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for sepsis?&lt;p&gt;Anyone with an infection could get sepsis.

Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; depend on which side of your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; is affected and how serious your condition has become.  Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and fluid buildup in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid buildup happens because the flow of blood through your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt;. Fluid may leak from the blood vessels and collect in the tissues of your body, causing swelling (edema) and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling short of breath (like you can't get enough air) when you do things like climbing stairs. This may be one of the first symptoms you notice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue or weakness even after rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling and weight gain from fluid in your ankles, lower legs, or abdomen (belly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty sleeping when lying flat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea and loss of appetite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling in the veins of your neck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing to urinate (pee) often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms will usually bother you more.&lt;/p&gt;What other problems does &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; cause?&lt;p&gt;Fluid buildup and reduced blood flow to your organs can lead to serious problems, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing problems from fluid in and around your lungs (also called congestive &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney or liver damage including cirrhosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Malnutrition if fluid buildup makes eating uncomfortable or if your stomach doesn't get enough blood flow to digest food properly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; conditions, such as irregular heartbeat and sudden &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pulmonary hypertension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To find out if you have &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;, your doctor will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do a physical exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will likely order &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; tests and blood tests, including a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Your treatment will depend on the type of &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; you have and how serious it is. There's no cure for &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;. But treatment can help you live longer with fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with treatment, &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; usually gets worse over time, so you'll likely need treatment for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most treatment plans include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking medicine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating less sodium and drinking less liquid to control fluid buildup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making other changes, such as quitting smoking, managing stress, and getting as much physical activity as your health care provider recommends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating any conditions that may make &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; worse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may need &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; surgery if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a congenital &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; defect or damage to your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; that can be fixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The left side of your &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; is getting weaker and putting a device in your chest could help.

Your provider may suggest a &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;cardiac&lt;/span&gt; rehabilitation program to help you learn how to manage your condition.&lt;/p&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You may be able to prevent or delay &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt; if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with your provider to manage any health conditions that increase your risk of developing &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make healthy changes in your eating, exercise, and other daily habits to help prevent &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;heart&lt;/span&gt; disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National &lt;span class=\"qt1\"&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt;, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html"},"Acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome":{"name":"HIV","summary":"What is HIV?&lt;p&gt;HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;What is AIDS?&lt;p&gt;AIDS stands for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;acquired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt; immunodeficiency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt2\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"qt3\"&gt;syndrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;How does HIV spread?&lt;p&gt;HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. \"Unprotected\" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By sharing drug needles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Who is at risk for HIV infection?&lt;p&gt;Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who have another sexually transmitted disease (STD). Having an STD can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who inject drugs with shared needles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gay and bisexual men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;What are the symptoms of HIV?&lt;p&gt;The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth ulcers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;How do I know if I have HIV?&lt;p&gt;A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for HIV?&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;Can HIV infection be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting tested for HIV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting tested and treated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not injecting drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking to your health care provider about medicines to prevent HIV:\n\t\t&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institutes of Health&lt;/p&gt;","url":"https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html"}}
